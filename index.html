    <h1>Plotform: Our Plain & Simple Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it â€“ no confusing jargon.</p>

    <h2>What Info We Collect:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> When you sign up, we collect your email address and basic account details. If you subscribe, our payment processor (Stripe) will collect your payment information. We don't store your full credit card details on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Content You Create With Plotform:</strong> When you use features like the Idea Generator or Script Writer, we process the text you input and the content the AI generates. We do this only to provide the service to you. Your specific creative inputs and outputs are yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect general data about how you use Plotform (e.g., which features are popular, how often they're used). This helps us improve the service, identify issues, and make Plotform better. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> To provide our AI features, your input is sent to our AI service providers. We have agreements with them to protect your data, and we only send what's necessary for the feature to work. We do not allow them to use your specific data to train their general models for other customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies & Site Data:</strong> Like most websites, we may use basic cookies for our website to function properly (e.g., keeping you logged in) and for simple analytics to understand how visitors use our site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Info:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To run Plotform and give you the services you signed up for.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your account, service updates, or important notices.</li>
        <li>To process your payments.</li>
        <li>To improve Plotform and develop new features (using aggregated or anonymized usage data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Don't Use Your Info (And How We Share):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell your personal data to third-party advertisers. Period.</li>
        <li>We only share your information with trusted service providers who help us run Plotform (like Stripe for payments, Supabase for our database/authentication, and our AI service providers). They are only authorized to use your information as necessary to provide their services to us.</li>
        <li>We might disclose your information if required by law (e.g., a subpoena).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Content is Yours:</h2>
    <p>As stated in our Terms, you own the content you create with Plotform. We don't use your specific scripts or ideas for anything other than providing the service back to you.</p>

    <h2>Data Security:</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no online service can be 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights:</h2>
    <p>You can usually review and update your account information. You can request deletion of your account (though some data may be retained for legal or operational reasons, like billing history).</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy:</h2>
    <p>Plotform is not intended for use by children under 16. We don't knowingly collect data from them.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy:</h2>
    <p>If we make important changes, we'll try to notify you.</p>

    <h2>Questions?:</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about your privacy, please contact us.</p>
