        <h1>Plotform: Our Plain & Simple Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Plotform! We're here to help you create amazing content. By using our service, you agree to these simple terms. Our goal is fairness and transparency.</p>

        <h2>What Plotform Is:</h2>
        <p>Plotform provides AI-powered tools for content idea generation, scriptwriting, script revision, and monetization planning. Think of us as your AI co-pilot for content creation.</p>

        <h2>Your Account:</h2>
        <p>You're responsible for your account details (like your password). Please use Plotform lawfully and don't try to misuse the service (e.g., creating harmful content, trying to break things, or excessively overloading the system).</p>

        <h2>Fair Use Policy (The Cap):</h2>
        <p>To keep Plotform running smoothly and affordably for everyone, each core feature (Idea Generator, Script Writer, Script Revision, Monetization Builder) has a generous cap of <strong>100 uses per month</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A "use" typically means one full generation cycle (e.g., getting 5 script ideas, writing one full script, one revision pass, one monetization plan).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe this is plenty for most creators. We might offer extra usage packs in the future if needed.</p>

        <h2>You Own Your Creations:</h2>
        <p><strong>You keep full copyright and ownership</strong> of the unique scripts and content ideas you generate with Plotform. We don't claim any rights to your work. Plotform owns its underlying AI, platform, and brand.</p>

        <h2>Subscription & Payment:</h2>
        <p>Plotform is a monthly subscription.</p>
        <p>Our first 100 Founding Members get their special discounted rate for life, as promised!</p>
        <p>You can cancel anytime. Your access will continue until the end of your current paid month. We don't offer partial monthly refunds.</p>

        <h2>Service Availability (Our "Restroom Break" Policy):</h2>
        <p>We work hard to keep Plotform online 24/7. Sometimes, things might need maintenance or face unexpected issues. We'll always aim to fix things quickly (not just when it's convenient for us) and will try to notify you of scheduled downtime. We can't guarantee 100% uptime, but we'll always do our best.</p>

        <h2>Using Plotform Wisely (Liability):</h2>
        <p>Plotform is a tool to help you. We're not responsible for how you use the content you create or any specific outcomes (like video views or income). Our financial liability to you is limited to the amount you paid for the service in the month an issue occurred.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms:</h2>
        <p>We may need to update these terms as Plotform evolves. We'll try to give you a heads-up on major changes. Using Plotform after an update means you accept the new terms.</p>

        <h2>Questions?:</h2>
        <p>We want you to love Plotform. If you have questions about these terms, please reach out.</p>
